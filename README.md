# AdversaryCombined
Base Set + MSE-ADV + MSE-ADV2, for easy consumption.

# To Install or Update
1. [Download the latest release here](https://github.com/Buluphont/AdversaryCombined/releases). They're marked as *source code*, but don't worry about that -- no code involved at all.

2. On Windows, move the downloaded .zip into `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Cockatrice`. For other platforms (or if you happen to have installed it elsewhere), move it to wherever Cockatrice is installed.

3. Right click the .zip and press 'Extract Here.' Overwrite all when prompted.

4. You're done!

- 4a. If you want to make sure it worked or are having issues, open Cockatrice, or restart it if was already open.

- 4b. Click 'Card Database' at the top and then click 'Open Custom Sets Folder' or 'Open Custom Images Folder'.

- 4c. If you see the downloaded .xmls and images inside, then it worked. If not, simply move the .xmls and images into those folders.
