# AdversaryCombined
Base Set + MSE-ADV + MSE-ADV2, for easy consumption.

# Introduction
Adversary is a custom format for Magic: The Gathering intended to be played over Cockatrice and other online clients.

- How is it played?

In Adversary, players select an Adversary card from our existing selection, or create their own. These Adversaries are in play from turn one, and possess abilities that change the way the game is played. If you've ever tried out Vanguard, you'll feel right at home.

- How are Adversaries balanced?

Each Adversary is assigned three values: a life total, a starting hand size, and a level. The life total and starting hand size are used to balance Adversaries based on the power of their abilities. In the event that they cannot be effectively balanced this way, Adversaries are also assigned a level, indicating that they are best suited for play against Adversaries of a similar level.

- How can I make my own Adversary?

Post your desired rules text, color identity, illustration and artist-to-credit in this thread and I might make it for you! 
Alternatively, make it yourself in Photoshop or an MTG card creation program and I may add it to the core .xml file.
If you'd like to go one step further, you can host your own complete .xml file which will require absolutely no moderation from me, which I will be happy to add to future OPs.

- Where can I find other players?

Just pop into our Discord server, which is currently the central hub for all things Adversary and where all the active players congregate.

# To Install or Update
1. [Download the latest release here](https://github.com/Buluphont/AdversaryCombined/releases). They're marked as *source code*, but don't worry about that -- no code involved at all.

2. On Windows, move the downloaded .zip into `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Cockatrice`. For other platforms (or if you happen to have installed it elsewhere), move it to wherever Cockatrice is installed.

3. Right click the .zip and press 'Extract Here.' Overwrite all when prompted.

4. You're done!

- 4a. If you want to make sure it worked or are having issues, open Cockatrice, or restart it if was already open.

- 4b. Click 'Card Database' at the top and then click 'Open Custom Sets Folder' or 'Open Custom Images Folder'.

- 4c. If you see the downloaded .xmls and images inside, then it worked. If not, simply move the .xmls and images into those folders.


# Not sure how to find Adversaries once you've got them downloaded?
Besides searching for their names, you can also use a Filtered search in Cockatrice. Search for the 'Adversary' card type, or the set name of your chosen packs.

# Basic Rules
- RULE ONE: Adversaries are not permanents, but they can still tap for convenience.
- RULE TWO: An Adversary's starting hand size is also considered their maximum hand size.
- RULE THREE: All players have one free mulligan (a free mulligan means drawing a new starting hand without reducing your starting hand size).
- RULE FOUR: Decks must contain a minimum of 61 cards, including your Adversary.
- RULE FIVE: The format is Modern Singleton.

# Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Isn't this just a rip-off of Vanguard?  
A. Yes, although it's less of an attempt to plagiarize it and more of an attempt to revive it with the addition of custom cards and more finely tuned balancing.
 
Q. Is there an easy way to check if my Cockatrice deck is Modern legal?  
A. Yes. In the deck builder, click Deck Editor > Analyze deck on deckstats.net, then scroll to the bottom. It will tell you if your deck is Modern legal or Legacy legal. If it's Legacy legal, you can then scroll through your decklist to find all the cards that are listed as Legacy legal.
 
Q. Does Velan gain life when her creatures damage an opponent?  
A. Yes. Damage counts as life loss (although life loss does not count as damage).
 
Q. Where does Deus summon his other Adversaries from?  
A. They are placed in the sideboard.

# Banlists (Adversary uses the official Modern banlist.)

##ADVERSARY SPECIFIC(It is very rare that a card would be banned for a specific Adversary, but some combos are just too broken.)

# Level Guideline
This is a guide detailing what it means for an Adversary to be at a certain Level. The Playable VS. Range indicates which Adversary levels it is 'safe' to play with, in that the matchup isn't so imbalanced as to be unplayable. Bear in mind that this isn't always correct; some Adversaries can be direct counters to others. A Level 1 Adversary may be able to destroy a Level 5 Adversary with the right ability.
 
Level 1: The most balanced Adversaries. Gameplay is nearly unaltered.
Playable VS. Range: 1-2
 
Level 2: Provide a noticeable advantage, while still being fair.
Playable VS. Range: 1-3
 
Level 3: Gameplay is significantly altered. Non-Adversary decks no longer stand a chance.
Playable VS. Range: 2-4 or multiple 1's.
 
Level 4: Incredibly powerful. Gameplay is no longer recognizable.
Playable VS. Range: 3-4 or multiple 2's.
 
Level 5: Don't even try.
Playable VS. Range: 5 or multiple 3-4's.
